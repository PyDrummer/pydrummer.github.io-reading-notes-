# Django, Using Models

> Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.

Always think about what data we need to store in the models.

Think of what information you'd store about books: (title, summary, author, written language, category, ISBN) and if you have multiple copies of that book: globally unique id, availability status, etc.

You might also want to use models to represent selection-list options (e.g. like a drop down list of choices), rather than hard coding the choices into the website itself â€” this is recommended when all the options aren't known up front or may change.

Define the relationships, Django allows you to define relationships that are one to one (OneToOneField), one to many (ForeignKey) and many to many (ManyToManyField).

Here is an example of a book model:

Some things to notice, in the BookInstance it does have a status feild showing if the book is available.

## Where do they go in a project?

Models are usually stored in the models.py file here is a typical model:

```
from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```
