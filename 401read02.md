# In Tests We Trust

## What are tests?

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

Its good to think "baby steps first" with code. Small tests we can do against a function.

Pay attention to the details such as the test name. We need to be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing.

Here is the article's example of how a test folder should look like:

```
mymodule/
 — module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — another_module.py
tests/
 — test_module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — test_another_module.py
```

### Structure

A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.

- Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
- Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
- Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

### The Cycle

The cycle is made by three steps:
- Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
- Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
- Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)

This is the baby steps we referenced earlier.

Once the test fails what is needed to make this test pass? Don’t think about the whole feature, just about the test.

### Design

Always keep your software's design in mind first!

When we are writing tests we are forced to think about the design first and how we can break it into small pieces.

When you craft the software design first you dont have to spend a bunch of time with fixes.

# Recursion

## What is recursion?

> The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

```
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```

In the above example, base case for n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved by converting to smaller one till base case is reached.

## How do we solve a problem with recursion?

We must represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems. Add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. 
> For example, we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1). The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0. 

## When errors occur in recursion

If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise.

## Direct and Indirect recursion

A function is called direct if it calls the same function. A function is called indirect if it calls another function. 

Example from the article:
```
// An example of direct recursion
void directRecFun()
{
    // Some code....

    directRecFun();

    // Some code...
}

// An example of indirect recursion
void indirectRecFun1()
{
    // Some code...

    indirectRecFun2();

    // Some code...
}
void indirectRecFun2()
{
    // Some code...

    indirectRecFun1();

    // Some code...
}
```

## Tailed and non-tailed recursion

A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function.

## Memory

A recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function and different copy of local variables is created for each function call. When the base case is reached, the function returns its value to the function by whom it is called and memory is de-allocated and the process continues.

Recursive example:
```
def printFun(test):
 
    if (test < 1):
        return
    else:
 
        print(test, end=" ")
        printFun(test-1)  # statement 2
        print(test, end=" ")
        return
 
# Driver Code
test = 3
printFun(test)

#output: 3 2 1 1 2 3 
```

How it works

> When printFun(3) is called from main(), memory is allocated to printFun(3) and a local variable test is initialized to 3 and statement 1 to 4 are pushed on the stack as shown in below diagram. It first prints ‘3’. In statement 2, printFun(2) is called and memory is allocated to printFun(2) and a local variable test is initialized to 2 and statement 1 to 4 are pushed in the stack. Similarly, printFun(2) calls printFun(1) and printFun(1) calls printFun(0). printFun(0) goes to if statement and it return to printFun(1). Remaining statements of printFun(1) are executed and it returns to printFun(2) and so on. In the output, value from 3 to 1 are printed and then 1 to 3 are printed. The memory stack has been shown in below diagram.

## Disadvantages of recursive vs iterative programming

Both recursive and iterative have the same problem-solving powers. Every recursive program can be written iteratively and vice versa.

The recursive program has greater space requirements than iterative program as all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. It also has greater time requirements because of function calls and returns overhead.

## Advantages of recursive vs iterative programming

Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code.
