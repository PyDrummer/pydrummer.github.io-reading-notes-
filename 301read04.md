# Grid Garden

My main take aways from this challenge is that after you've set a grid like this:

```
{
display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}
```

You can use short hand grid-column & grid-row on selected elements to move them around in the grid.

```
#cool-element {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 5;
}
```

If you want the elements to take up multiple grids give grid-column and grid-row 2 numbers like this: 2/4 so it starts on the second row and ends on the 4th row.

There is another option as well: grid-area here is an example:

```
grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;
// the first number determines which vertical row it starts,
// the second number determins the horizontal row number it starts on
// the third number determins how many rows it will cover vertically
// the fourth number determins how many rows it will cover horizontally

```

When handling multiple items you can overlap them with grid-area to define a second area that covers all of the grid areas you want.

Using Order,

By default, all grid items have an order of 0, but this can be set to any positive or negative value, similar to z-index.

Customize your grid,

The example above uses the grid at 20% for each column. You can customize the row percentages though.

Use the Repeate while customizing your grid so you dont have to repeate the percentages when creating rows or columns

example from the challenge
```
#garden {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 12.5%); //<- this right here
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}
```

Grid also introduces a new unit, the fractional fr. Each fr unit allocates one share of the available space. For example, if two elements are set to 1fr and 3fr respectively, the space is divided into 4 equal shares; the first element occupies 1/4 and the second element 3/4 of any leftover space.

fr is a bit confusing to use but here is a great example:

In the picture example the two sides are defined with 50px then the middle uses fr to just assign the fraction of space. fr will determine how many columns get taken up.
