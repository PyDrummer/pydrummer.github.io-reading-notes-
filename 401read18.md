# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

## What is encryption/decryption/cracking?

Encryption is taking a message and turning into a coded a message. Usually requires a key and a set of rules.

Decryption is unraveling that message to what it was before it was encrypted. Usually requires the same key used from encrypting and the rules reversed.

Cracking is basically decrypting a message without having the key or encryption rules.

## Caesar Cipher

Also known as the shift cipher, this is one of the simplest and widely known encryption types.

Each letter in the plaintext of a message is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Example:

Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
