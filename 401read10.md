# Stacks and Queues

## What is stack?

A data struct that consists of nodes.

These nodes reference the next node but doesnt reference the previous.

Common terms to remember:

- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Stacks follow the First In Last Out and Last In First Out. Basically the first thing added to the stack will be the last one to pop out.

### Push

Pushing a node will always be a Big O of O(1). Basically no matter how many nodes it takes the same amount of time to push a new one.

When pushing a new node you must assign the node's next to the top's next and set the new pushed node to the top.

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

### Pop

Pop is the reverse of push. You're popping something out of the stack.

Make sure you make a temp variable that will store the current top. Next reassign the next property to the top. Only then can you remove the temp storing that original top node.

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

### Peek

Basically just used to see what value the top node has in the stack.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

### Is empty?

While running push, and pop you'll want to check if the stack is empty. If it is empty you'll want to raise an exception. Here's how to check:

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```
It will return a boolean of True or False. Letting you know if the stack is empty or not.

## What is a Queue

<img src="https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Queue.PNG" width=400 height=200>

- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

Queue follows FIFO (first in first out) and LILO (last in last out). The opposite of Stack.

### Enqueue

Has a Big O of O(1) because similar to the stack it doesnt matter how many nodes there are it takes the same amount of time to operate.

Enqueue adds a node to the end of the Queue.

First you'll change the next value of the rear node (the last node in the Queue). Then reassign the rear reference point to this newly added node.

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

### Dequeue

Also has a Big O of O(1) see the similar reason in Enqueue.

Dequeue does what it sounds like it does, takes something out of the queue. We will remove the front most node in the queue.

Similar to pop for the stack we begin by storing the front in a temp reference type. Reassign the front the temp's next value. Finally don't forget to reassign the temp's next to null so there are no more references to the Queue.

```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

### Peek

Peek is primarily the same as stack's peek but referencing front.value:

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

### Is Empty?

Again very similar to stack's IsEmpty but referencing the front

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
