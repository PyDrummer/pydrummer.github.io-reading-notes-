# EJS Partials

### What are they and why use them?

EJS Partials are useful for when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.

Useful reuse items could be:
- Top of the body such as the title of the app/website
- navigation bars
- footers

By creating nav.ejs, footer.ejs you can recycle these into your main/index.ejs page or any other so you dont have to repeat writing that code!

Here is how to grab that partial and put it into the index.ejs or any other page:

```
<%- include('partials/footer') %>
```

As long as the route is correct then you're good to go!
