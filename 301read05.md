# Heroku Deployment

Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI is used to manage and scale my applications, add-ons, view logs and run the app locally.

After verifying all versions were up to date I then git cloned https://intense-badlands-94760.herokuapp.com/ to start the heroku process.

Next by using heroku create it created the app. Used git push heroku main to update the git directory.

Once the verifications were completed for that I followed the steps heroku open and it opened: https://intense-badlands-94760.herokuapp.com/

Finally at the "View logs" portion i used heroku logs --tail to see some data.
