# Classes and Objects

Here is an example of how to make a class and how to access it's variable.

```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

print(myobjectx.variable)
myobjectx.function()
```

Thing's to notice is you can access the class by using dot notation.

Classes can have variables and functions inside.

## Recursive Functions in Python

A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. 

All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.
