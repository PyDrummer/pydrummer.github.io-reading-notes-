### Before i start taking notes i should check that everything is good to go.
- [x] Computer is on?
- [x] Ready to learn?
- [ ] ***Is my fridge running?***
### *Now* that i'm ready to read i better take notes.
>"I'm thinking of keeping notes with a table based off each reading material."
#### Thats ~~not a bad idea~~ a great idea!
| Reading material | Notes |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 1 | |
| 2 | |
| 3 | |

Or ***maybe*** I could us an unordered list...
* 1 Notes
* 2 Notes
  * extra note
    * wait almost forgot this note too
