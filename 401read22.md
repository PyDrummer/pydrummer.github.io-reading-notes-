# Django Forms!

## This is going to be a quick crash course on how to use forms within Django

As we all know by now, a form is used to collect user input. That input can be stored on your server or other purposes.

Forms typically have a combination of text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons or date pickers.

### So, how is a Django form handled?

> The view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). 

So let's start with defining the book form.

Start by creating the file in your app: forms.py

Import the forms library and do this:

```
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
    
# replace the word Book to whatever you want
```

Notice the help text, this is what the user will see when the form isnt filled out yet.

Here are some of the other fields you might use:

BooleanField, CharField, ChoiceField, TypedChoiceField, DateField, DateTimeField, DecimalField, DurationField, EmailField, FileField, FilePathField, FloatField, ImageField, IntegerField, GenericIPAddressField, MultipleChoiceField, TypedMultipleChoiceField, NullBooleanField, RegexField, SlugField, TimeField, URLField, UUIDField, ComboField, MultiValueField, SplitDateTimeField, ModelMultipleChoiceField, ModelChoiceField.

Here are some of the other arguments you might want to add to your field, seperated by a comma after adding them.

- required: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
- label: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
- label_suffix: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal date:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
- initial: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
- widget: The display widget to use.
- help_text (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
- error_messages: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
- validators: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
- localize: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
- disabled: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.

### Lets validate the data before sending it our server!

```
import datetime

from django import forms
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

    def clean_renewal_date(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']

        # Check if a date is not in the past.
        if data < datetime.date.today():
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))

        # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
        if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))

        # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
        return data
```

Notice the clean_renewal_date class function here. This will retrun at the end of our function and "clean" the form for the next entry.

### Add to our urls.py

In our app's urls.py add this:

```
urlpatterns += [
    path('book/<uuid:pk>/renew/', views.renew_book_librarian, name='renew-book-librarian'),
]
```

> The URL configuration will redirect URLs with the format /catalog/book/<bookinstance_id>/renew/ to the function named renew_book_librarian() in views.py, and send the BookInstance id as the parameter named pk. The pattern only matches if pk is a correctly formatted uuid.


### Views

The view must render the defualt form, then re-render it with errors if the data is in valid or process and redirect to a new page if the data is valid.

For forms that use a POST request to submit information to the server, the most common pattern is for the view to test against the POST request type (if request.method == 'POST':) to identify form validation requests and GET (using an else condition) to identify the initial form creation request. 

Things that write to the database use POST request. Here's an example:

```
import datetime

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, permission_required
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse

from catalog.forms import RenewBookForm

@login_required
@permission_required('catalog.can_mark_returned', raise_exception=True)
def renew_book_librarian(request, pk):
    """View function for renewing a specific BookInstance by librarian."""
    book_instance = get_object_or_404(BookInstance, pk=pk)

    # If this is a POST request then process the Form data
    if request.method == 'POST':

        # Create a form instance and populate it with data from the request (binding):
        form = RenewBookForm(request.POST)

        # Check if the form is valid:
        if form.is_valid():
            # process the data in form.cleaned_data as required (here we just write it to the model due_back field)
            book_instance.due_back = form.cleaned_data['renewal_date']
            book_instance.save()

            # redirect to a new URL:
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('all-borrowed') )

    # If this is a GET (or any other method) create the default form.
    else:
        proposed_renewal_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=3)
        form = RenewBookForm(initial={'renewal_date': proposed_renewal_date})

    context = {
        'form': form,
        'book_instance': book_instance,
    }

    return render(request, 'catalog/book_renew_librarian.html', context)
```

Here is a quick breakdown of the important stuff:

- get_object_or_404(): Returns a specified object from a model based on its primary key value, and raises an Http404 exception (not found) if the record does not exist.
- HttpResponseRedirect: This creates a redirect to a specified URL (HTTP status code 302).
- reverse(): This generates a URL from a URL configuration name and a set of arguments. It is the Python equivalent of the url tag that we've been using in our templates.
- datetime: A Python library for manipulating dates and times.

And here is what the HTML template would look like:

```
{% extends "base_generic.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Renew: {{ book_instance.book.title }}</h1>
  <p>Borrower: {{ book_instance.borrower }}</p>
  <p{% if book_instance.is_overdue %} class="text-danger"{% endif %}>Due date: {{ book_instance.due_back }}</p>

  <form action="" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <table>
    {{ form.as_table }}
    </table>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
{% endblock %}


## {{ form.as_table}} Template:
<tr>
  <th><label for="id_renewal_date">Renewal date:</label></th>
    <td>
      <ul class="errorlist">
        <li>Invalid date - renewal in past</li>
      </ul>
      <input id="id_renewal_date" name="renewal_date" type="text" value="2015-11-08" required>
      <br>
      <span class="helptext">Enter date between now and 4 weeks (default 3 weeks).</span>
    </td>
</tr>
```

### Is there another way to do this?

Yes, you can use ModelForms:

Rather than recreating the model definitions in your form, it is easier to use the ModelForm helper class to create the form from your model. This ModelForm can then be used within your views in exactly the same way as an ordinary Form.

A basic ModelForm containing the same field as our original RenewBookForm is shown below. All you need to do to create the form is add class Meta with the associated model (BookInstance) and a list of the model fields to include in the form.

```
from django.forms import ModelForm

from catalog.models import BookInstance

from django.forms import ModelForm

from catalog.models import BookInstance

class RenewBookModelForm(ModelForm):
    def clean_due_back(self):
       data = self.cleaned_data['due_back']

       # Check if a date is not in the past.
       if data < datetime.date.today():
           raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))

       # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
       if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
           raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))

       # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
       return data

    class Meta:
        model = BookInstance
        fields = ['due_back']
        labels = {'due_back': _('Renewal date')}
        help_texts = {'due_back': _('Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).')}
```

The class RenewBookModelForm above is now functionally equivalent to our original RenewBookForm. You could import and use it wherever you currently use RenewBookForm as long as you also update the corresponding form variable name from renewal_date to due_back as in the second form declaration: RenewBookModelForm(initial={'due_back': proposed_renewal_date}.

### Final comments:

Using {{ form.as_table }} as shown above, each field is rendered as a table row. You can also render each field as a list item (using {{ form.as_ul }} ) or as a paragraph (using {{ form.as_p }}).
