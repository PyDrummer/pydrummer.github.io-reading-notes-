# Refactoring 

## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

### What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

### What is a pure function:

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects

An impure function uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.

If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.

Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

Example of a pure function:
```
let counter = 1;

const increaseCounter = (value) => value + 1;

increaseCounter(counter); // 2
console.log(counter); // 1
```
The pure function increaseCounter returns 2, but the counter value is still the same. The function returns the incremented value without altering the value of the variable.

Pure functions benefits

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

- Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
- Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

### Immutability

> When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

How do we handle mutability in iteration? Recursion!

```
let list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let accumulator = 0;

function sum(list, accumulator) {
  if (list.length == 0) {
    return accumulator;
  }

  return sum(list.slice(1), accumulator + list[0]);
}

sum(list, accumulator); // 15
list; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
accumulator; // 0
```

The code above slices from list and adds the accumulator to list at the instance of 0 until the list.length is 0.

With recursion, we keep our variables immutable. The list and the accumulator variables are not changed. It keeps the same value.

### Referential transparency

The article starts with a square function:
```
const square = (n) => n * n;
```

> This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.

```
square(2); // 4
square(2); // 4
square(2); // 4
```
Passing 2 as a parameter of the square function will always returns 4. So now we can replace the square(2) with 4. That's it! Our function is referentially transparent.

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

> pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## Higher-order functions

When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result

Examples of higher order functions are filter, map, and reduce.

### Filter

> The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection. 

A "imperative" way to filter with JS is to create an empty array, iterate an already created array of numbers, push the even/odd numbers to the new empty array with filter.

```
var numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
var evenNumbers = [];

for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}

console.log(evenNumbers); // (6) [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

An even easier way:

```
const even = n => n % 2 == 0;
const listOfNumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
listOfNumbers.filter(even); // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Map

> The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

Example "imperative" way:

```
var people = [
  { name: "TK", age: 26 },
  { name: "Kaio", age: 10 },
  { name: "Kazumi", age: 30 }
];

var peopleSentences = [];

for (var i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  var sentence = people[i].name + " is " + people[i].age + " years old";
  peopleSentences.push(sentence);
}

console.log(peopleSentences); // ['TK is 26 years old', 'Kaio is 10 years old', 'Kazumi is 30 years old']
```
Easier "Declarative" way:
```
const makeSentence = (person) => `${person.name} is ${person.age} years old`;

const peopleSentences = (people) => people.map(makeSentence);
  
peopleSentences(people);
// ['TK is 26 years old', 'Kaio is 10 years old', 'Kazumi is 30 years old']
```

### Reduce

> The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.

Example:

```
let shoppingCart = [
  { productTitle: "Functional Programming", type: "books", amount: 10 },
  { productTitle: "Kindle", type: "eletronics", amount: 30 },
  { productTitle: "Shoes", type: "fashion", amount: 20 },
  { productTitle: "Clean Code", type: "books", amount: 60 }
]

const byBooks = (order) => order.type == "books";
const getAmount = (order) => order.amount;
const sumAmount = (acc, amount) => acc + amount;

function getTotalAmount(shoppingCart) {
  return shoppingCart
    .filter(byBooks)
    .map(getAmount)
    .reduce(sumAmount, 0);
}

getTotalAmount(shoppingCart); // 70
```

## Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability

This article talks about how to refactor JS. Their example is a URL shortner program.

When we want to convert short (URL function) to long (URL), on average we need to check half of those buckets before we find the correct short URL. What if we have thousands of buckets, and we perform this hundreds of times a second? The answer is a hash function

> A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table.

They talk about Cacheing variables so functions can be read like sentences:

```
function searchGroups(name) {
  for (let i = 0; i < continents.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < continents[i].length; j++) {
      for (let k = 0; k < continents[i][j].tags.length; k++) {
        if (continents[i][j].tags[k] === name) {
          return continents[i][j].id;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Refactor into ->

function searchGroups(name) {
  for (let i = 0; i < continents.length; i++) {
    const group = continents[i]; // This code becomes self-documenting
    for (let j = 0; j < group.length; j++) {
      const tags = group[j].tags;
      for (let k = 0; k < tags.length; k++) {
        if (tags[k] === name) {
          return group[j].id; // The core of this nasty loop is clearer to read
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> It's important to get your code right the first time because in many businesses there isn't much value in refactoring. Or at least, it's hard to convince stakeholders that eventually uncared for codebases will grind productivity to a halt.
