# Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices

## Environments

Within a project you might have multiple environments. We need a way to configure each environment.

You do not want sensitive data to be exposed in your Django project.

## Setting configs

> There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them.

You can use a settings_local.py file to keep all environment-specific settings in one file.

Here is an example of what the settings.py would look like

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
DEBUG = False
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}

...

from .settings_local import *
```

And the example of what settings_local.py would look like
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

A different way is to seperate settings files for each enviroment.

> This is an extension of the previous approach. It allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers.

A another option is to use environment variables.

# How does ssh work?

Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

The SSH key command instructs your system that you want to open an encrypted Secure Shell Connection. {user} represents the account you want to access. For example, you may want to access the root user, which is basically synonymous for system administrator with complete rights to modify anything on the system. {host} refers to the computer you want to access. This can be an IP Address (e.g. 244.235.23.19) or a domain name (e.g. www.xyzdomain.com).
