# Linked Lists

## What is a linked list?

A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

There are 2 types of linked lists: Singly and Doubly.

Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

### The internals

- Node - Contains the data for each link

- Next - Each node has this property, it says which node to go to next

- Head - A reference type of node to the first node in the list.

- Current - this is the type of node currently being looked at. This is also used when traversing throuhg a linked list.

### Traversing a linked list

You must use a while loop to continually check the Next node in the list unless it's value is Null. 

```
ALGORTIHM Includes (value)
		// INPUT <-- integer value
		// OUTPUT <-- boolean
			
			Current <-- Head

			WHILE Current is not NULL
				IF Current.Value is equal to value
					return TRUE

				Current <-- Current.Next

			return FALSE
```
The idea in the algorithm above says the current is = to the head. While the current is not null and if the current's value is equal to value return true saying this is the node you're looking for.

Other wise the current become's the current's next value and continue this process until all options are exahusted and return false.

### Big O

Regardless of the number of Nodes that this linked list has, it will always be a O(1) time and space because it takes the same amount of time to add a new node to the beginning of the list, and no additional resources are being used
