# Diversity and inclusion

## Consider the history

### Article: Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male.

In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women.

According to Glassdoor, 11 of the 25 best-paying jobs are technology related, with an average earning potential of between $106,000 and $130,000 a year.

The article attributes to less women in technology back in the 80s due to to the gaming industry. The gaminy industry primarily focused their marketing towards boys.

Though there are examples of both vintage and contemporary computer advertising aimed at women, it is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close.
