# Dynamic Routes,

## Focuses on individual pages within next.js

Each post should have a path that includes an ID. 

> First, weâ€™ll create a page called [id].js under pages/posts. Pages that begin with [ and end with ] are dynamic routes in Next.js.


Here is an example:
```
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
  return <Layout>...</Layout>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Return a list of possible value for id
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch necessary data for the blog post using params.id
}
```

Post() will return the actual information to the webpage. getStaticPaths() gets a list of possible values the ID is. 

The post page will end up using the getPostData function in getStaticProps to get the post data and return it as props.

The urls will end up looking like this: /pages/posts/[id].js

To render markdown content in js use the remark library.

```
** in the console:
npm install remark remark-html

** in the project:
import remark from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'
```
