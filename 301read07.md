### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

From my 201 notes a quick summary of this article:
> As long as each team member got to speak the team did well. It's a turn-taking thing.
If only one person spoke the collective intelligence declined.
A foundation of a good team is one where the members dont get embarrassed, rejected or punish for bringing up an idea.

### REST

HTTP, the GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

> The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

A URL tells the browser what to ask for to bring back to the user.

APIs are a way for computers to send messages back and forth to each other. 

> we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.

URLs let all type of systems "talk" to each other

Verbs and nouns in code...

When you visit a website the browers GETs the URL information to the webpage.

Everything on that website uses it's own GET 'verb's' to get the media on the webpage.

> If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH.
