# Random, Risk & Big O

## What is the Random Module in Python?

This module will simulate creating a random number. It must be imported first and called with a fuction called randint. Randint accepts 2 parameters (lowest, highest).

Random number example:
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```
The first index will be 1 larger than the lowest number you enter so the output will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

If you need to choose a random element from a list use the Choice function:

```
random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] ).
```

If you are creating a card game and need to shuffle these cards into random orders use Shuffle

```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
```
These are just a couple of examples of how to use the Random Module.

## Risk Analysis in Software Testing

### What is it?

Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

By using risk analysis you can identify potential problem areas before beginning.

### Risk Assessment

The 3 elements of a risk assessment:

- Effect, To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

- Cause, To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
 
- Likelihood, To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.

Great, so how do we preform an assessment?

Search the risk, analy the impact of each risk, measure for the risk.

## Big O with Gayle Laakmann McDowell

Transfering data over the internet takes longer depending on how much data there is.

O of n scales respect to the size of the input
