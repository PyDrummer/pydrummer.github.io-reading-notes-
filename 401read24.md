# Hashtable

## What is it?

- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

You must make sure your hashing algorithm is not hackable.

If the hashes are repeated you can chain the buckets with collisions. Example:

```
   1       2       3       4
[Name1] [Name2] [Name3] [Name5]
           |
        [Name4]
```

### First thing you must decide when creating a hashtable: How many buckets will it have?

If you change the hashtable size you must re-hash and re-add everything to the new hashtable.

When creating the hash function you have to take into consideration the length of the hashtable when creating the key. The key cant exceed the lenght of the hashtable.

Keys also must be greater than or equal to 0, cant be negative numbers.

## How to hash

We convert the input string to ascii values (using ord() function), add these numbers and store them in a variable. 

Mulitply the value by a prime number.

Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.

Use that result and insert it into the array at that index.

## How to add 

Add function takes a key and value,

Hash the key first.

Check if the bucket is empty, if yes add a new node here. If not add to the node with a linkedlist.

Import a linkedlist class. 

Check if there is already a value at that bucket's index. if yes, instanciate an empty linkedlist at that index within the buckets.

Otherwise we use the .add() from the linkedlist class with a key and value pair tuple at the self.buckets[index]

## How to make the buckets

Within the hashtable, add a self._buckets = size * [none], We are creating x amount of empty buckets.

## How to get

Have the function take in a key, hash the key and check if any bucket contains that hashed index. 

Since each bucket is full of a linkedlist instanciation, get the head of that linkedlist and assign it to current. 

Check that current[0] matches the key. Create a while loop (while current:) If the key doesnt match then current becomes current.next

Once we get a match store current[1] a temp variable.

Return that value.

## How to build contains

Contains is basically the same as get, but instead return "true" or "false" if it's in the hashtable.
