## Sending data

Client/server architecture
At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

By using a form you can define the data that will be sent.

Inside the form you'll need an action to define the path and a method to define how you're sending the data (public or private).

Here is an example of a get method
```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```
Since the GET method has been used, you'll see the URL www.foo.com/?say=Hi&to=Mom appear in the browser address bar when you submit the form.

The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

## Retrieving data

We currently have mainly used express with node js to retrieve data.

```
app.get('/route')
app.post('/route')
```
These are two main examples of getting data from the form.

## Security

Each time you send data to a server, you need to consider security. HTML forms are by far the most common server attack vectors (places where attacks can occur). The problems never come from the HTML forms themselves â€” they come from how the server handles data.
