# Trees

## Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree Overview

Terminology to know:

- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure

- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree

- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node

- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node

- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children

- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## How to traverse

### Depth first: prioritizing going through the height of the tree first.

```
Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root

############################

ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)

############################

ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)


############################

ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

```

Basically you use a stack to search for the correct output.

### Breadth First: traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

```
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    if front.left is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.left)

    if front.right is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.right)
```

This method utilizes the queue to find the value


## Binary Trees

There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here is what a binary tree looks like:

#### How to add a node:

There are no structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go” in a binary tree. One strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down. 


#### BIG O

Most of the functions like inserting a node, searching for a node are O(n). A “perfect” binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. The maximum width for a perfect binary tree, is 2^(h-1)


## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it.

Basically you will have a value that you compare against the value of the root. If it is not a match then keep searching.
