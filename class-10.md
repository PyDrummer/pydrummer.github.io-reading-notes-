# Error Handling & Debugging

Lets make a quick how-to guide

Something to keep in mind while handling errors is the order of execution. Specifically how the code runs.

### JavaScript interpertes one line of code at at time!

By setting good rules within your statements the code will flow nicely based on the other functions triggering.

It's a good rule of thumb to practice
1. Prepare
  - Varibales, functions and arguments
2. Execute
  - assign values to varibales, reference functions and run that code, execute statements
