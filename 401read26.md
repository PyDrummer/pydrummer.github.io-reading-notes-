# DRF Permissions

## What is it?

Django REST framework permissions.

At the beginning of the view a permission check is ran. Before any other code will run an authentification check must be made. Depending on the user's permissions they will then be able to see certain parts of the website.

## How to determine permissions.

``` IsAuthenticated ``` Allows access to any authenticated user, and deny access to any unauthenticated user.

``` IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly ``` Allows full access to authenticated users, but allow read-only access to unauthenticated users.

REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. 

Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

Here is an example:

```
def get_object(self):
    obj = get_object_or_404(self.get_queryset(), pk=self.kwargs["pk"])
    self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)
    return obj
```

## How to set a permission policy.

Within the project's settings add this:
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```

To set permissions per view:

```
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```

## API References for permissions.

- AllowAny: permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.
- IsAuthenticated: permission class will deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise.
- IsAdminUser: permission class will deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True in which case permission will be allowed.
