# Reading and Writing Files in Python

## What is a file?

A file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. The data is organized in a specific format. It can be simple or complex.
 
Examples include a simple text file up to a complex executable program.

The three main parts of a file system:

- Header metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
- Data contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
- EOF (End of file) special character that indicates the end of the file

## File Paths

When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

- Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- File Name: the actual name of the file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

Example of a file struct:

```
/
│
├── path/
|   │
│   ├── to/
│   │   └── cats.gif
│   │
│   └── dog_breeds.txt
|
└── animals.csv
```

To navigate and locate files you use the forward slash "/" to move around this file struct.

## Line Endings

It's inmportant to know how to work with new lines or line endings.

Windows uses the CR+LF characters to indicate a new line, while Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the LF character. This can cause some complications when you’re processing files on an operating system that is different than the file’s source.

Here is an example of a .txt file created on windows:

```
Pug\r\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r\n
English Springer Spaniel\r\n
German Shepherd\r\n
Staffordshire Bull Terrier\r\n
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\r\n
Golden Retriever\r\n
West Highland White Terrier\r\n
Boxer\r\n
Border Terrier\r\n
```
And here is how it would look on a Unix device:
```
Pug\r
\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r
\n
English Springer Spaniel\r
\n
German Shepherd\r
\n
Staffordshire Bull Terrier\r
\n
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\r
\n
Golden Retriever\r
\n
West Highland White Terrier\r
\n
Boxer\r
\n
Border Terrier\r
\n
```

Why is this important? When iterating over each line this can become problemactic so it's good to know about it.

# Working with a file in Python

## I bolded this one because it's pretty important

```
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
```

### After you open a file, the next thing to learn is how to close it.

In most cases, upon termination of an application or script, a file will be closed eventually. However, there is no guarantee when exactly that will happen. This can lead to unwanted behavior including resource leaks. 
 
The first way to close a file is the "try-finally" block, example:
```
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()
```

The second way is with a "with" statement:
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error.

The article highly recommends using the with statement as much as possible.

> You’ll also want to use the second positional argument, mode. This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to represent how you want to open the file. The default and most common is 'r', which represents opening the file in read-only mode as a text file:

```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

The most commonly used modes are:

- 'r' open for reading
- 'w' open for writing (overwriting the file)
- 'rb' or 'wb' open in bianry mode (read/write using byte data)

## File object types

### Text files 

The most common file that will be encountered. Here is how they are opened:

```
open('abc.txt')

open('abc.txt', 'r')

open('abc.txt', 'w')

# they will retrun a TextIOWrapper file object:
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
type(file)
<class '_io.TextIOWrapper'>
```

### Buffered binary files 
A buffered binary file type is used for reading and writing binary files. Here is how to open them:

```
open('abc.txt', 'rb')

open('abc.txt', 'wb')

# open() will return either a BufferedReader or BufferedWriter file object:
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb')
type(file)
<class '_io.BufferedReader'>
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'wb')
type(file)
<class '_io.BufferedWriter'>
```

### Raw binary files
This is not typically used. Here is how you do it though:
```
open('abc.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)

#open() will return a FileIO file object:

file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
type(file)
<class '_io.FileIO'>
```

Each of these file types are defined in the io module. Here’s a quick rundown of how everything lines up.

## Reading and Writing these files

### Reading:

Example
```
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read & print the entire file
>>>     print(reader.read())
Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier
```

By using the .read() or .readline/s() methods you can sepcify how much you want to read:

- .read(size=-1)	

This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.

- .readlines()	

This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.

- .readline(size=-1)	

This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.

Using .readline():

```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read & print the first 5 characters of the line 5 times
>>>     print(reader.readline(5))
Pug
# something to notice, if you select (5) multiple times it will wrap the words as they print out:
>>>     print(reader.readline(5))
>>>     print(reader.readline(5))
>>>     print(reader.readline(5))
>>>     print(reader.readline(5))
Jack
Russe
ll Te
rrier
```

.readlines() can create a list/array object of strings from the text file, alternatively you can use list(<stored .txt file variable here>) to accomplish the same thing.

```
>>> f = open('dog_breeds.txt')
>>> f.readlines()  # Returns a list object
['Pug\n', 'Jack Russell Terrier\n', 'English Springer Spaniel\n', 'German Shepherd\n', 'Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n', 'Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n', 'Golden Retriever\n', 'West Highland White Terrier\n', 'Boxer\n', 'Border Terrier\n']
>>> f = open('dog_breeds.txt')
>>> list(f)
['Pug\n', 'Jack Russell Terrier\n', 'English Springer Spaniel\n', 'German Shepherd\n', 'Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n', 'Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n', 'Golden Retriever\n', 'West Highland White Terrier\n', 'Boxer\n', 'Border Terrier\n']
```

## Iterating over each line in the file

```
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     line = reader.readline()
>>>     while line != '':  # The EOF char is an empty string
>>>         print(line, end='')
>>>         line = reader.readline()

# OR
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     for line in reader.readlines():
>>>         print(line, end='')

# OR
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     for line in reader:
>>>         print(line, end='')

# will result in the output:
Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier
```

### Writing

Method's to know:
- .write(string)	

This writes the string to the file.

- .writelines(seq)	

This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. It’s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).

And the example:
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # Note: readlines doesn't trim the line endings
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()

with open('dog_breeds_reversed.txt', 'w') as writer:
    # Alternatively you could use
    # writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))

    # Write the dog breeds to the file in reversed order
    for breed in reversed(dog_breeds):
        writer.write(breed)

# Working with bytes:
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb') as reader:
>>>     print(reader.readline())
b'Pug\n'
```

Okay let's say you want to open a png file. We will use the 'rb' as byte_reader Example:

```
>>> with open('jack_russell.png', 'rb') as byte_reader:
>>>     print(byte_reader.read(1))
>>>     print(byte_reader.read(3))
>>>     print(byte_reader.read(2))
>>>     print(byte_reader.read(1))
>>>     print(byte_reader.read(1))
b'\x89'
b'PNG'
b'\r\n'
b'\x1a'
b'\n'
```

### Appending to a File

If you want to add to the end of an exisitng populated file do use the 'a' character in the "mode" argument of the write method this:

```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'a') as a_writer:
    a_writer.write('\nBeagle')
```

now Beagle will be added to the end of the dog_breeds.txt file.

### Working with 2 files at the same time.

> There are times when you may want to read a file and write to another file at the same time. If you use the example that was shown when you were learning how to write to a file, it can actually be combined into the following:

```
d_path = 'dog_breeds.txt'
d_r_path = 'dog_breeds_reversed.txt'
with open(d_path, 'r') as reader, open(d_r_path, 'w') as writer:
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()
    writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))
```

the d_path, 'r' is what you are reading and d_r_path, 'w' is what you are writing to.

# Python Exceptions

### A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error.

Types of Errors:

Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.

Exception error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error.

### Raising an Exception

We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs.

Example:
```
x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception('x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: {}'.format(x))
    
# what it will output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 4, in <module>
Exception: x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: 10
```

> Instead of waiting for a program to crash midway, you can also start by making an assertion in Python. We assert that a certain condition is met. If this condition turns out to be True, then that is excellent! The program can continue. If the condition turns out to be False, you can have the program throw an AssertionError exception.

Example:
```
import sys
assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "This code runs on Linux only."

# so if the code can only be executed on a linux system it will say that string
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 2, in <module>
AssertionError: This code runs on Linux only.
````

## The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions

<img src="https://files.realpython.com/media/try_except.c94eabed2c59.png">

Example:
```
def linux_interaction():
    assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "Function can only run on Linux systems."
    print('Doing something.')

#Give the function a try/except block:
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
    print('Linux function was not executed')
    
output:
Function can only run on Linux systems.
The linux_interaction() function was not executed

```

If the try doesnt work then the except will run.

Here is another example where you open a file and use a built-in exception:

```
try:
    with open('file.log') as file:
        read_data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
    print(fnf_error)
    
# output:
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file.log'
```

The file.log did not exist so it ran the except block.

### Else clause

With Else you can instruct the program to execute a certain block of code in the absense of exceptions.

```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    print('Executing the else clause.')
    
#output:
Doing something.
Executing the else clause.
```

You can use try inside the else clause:

```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    try:
        with open('file.log') as file:
            read_data = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
        print(fnf_error)
        
#output:
Doing something.
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file.log'
```

### Finally

<img src="https://files.realpython.com/media/try_except_else_finally.a7fac6c36c55.png">

> Imagine that you always had to implement some sort of action to clean up after executing your code. Python enables you to do so using the finally clause.

```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    try:
        with open('file.log') as file:
            read_data = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
        print(fnf_error)
finally:
    print('Cleaning up, irrespective of any exceptions.')

#output:
Function can only run on Linux systems.
Cleaning up, irrespective of any exceptions.
```

Everything in the finally clause will be executed. It does not matter if you encounter an exception somewhere in the try or else clauses.
