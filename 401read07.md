# Python Scope

## What is scope?

Basically the rules of how variables and names are looked up in your code. The visability of your code.

## Global and local scope

- Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

Python turns your program's script into a module called __main__ to do the main execution. 

**Important to remember:** There’s only one global Python scope per program execution.

- Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

Basically scope decides what can be seen by all code and what can only be seen inside a function/class/import/assignment.

## What is namespace?

> Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .__dict__.

## LEGB rule

Local, the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. 

Enclosing (non-local), a special scope that only exists for nested functions.

Global, the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module.

Built-in scopes, a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.

# Don't be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!

Time complexity, space complexity. How many things are you giving to the algorithm?, how much time does it take to do the thing? How much memory is being allocated to do the thing?

Big O can give you the worst case scenario of how long your algo will take to do the things.

Different types:

O(1) Constant run time, runs at the same time constantly

O(log n) logarithmic run time, starts slow then ramps up. Scales well with more data given. (binary search)

O(n) linear run time, scales with time and input

O(n logn) log-linear run time, more time used with more inputs

O(nk) polynominal run time
