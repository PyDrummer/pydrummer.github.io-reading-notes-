# Introduction to Node.js!

### What is it?

> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Built on google chrome's v8 js engine, which is open-source. It compilies js directly to native machine code for your computer.

Node has features like a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system.

How to install packages globally.

npm install -g <package name here\>

How to install packages locally

npm init -y

This will create and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder.

### What is Node.js used for?

Node.js is great for automating the process of developing moder js applications.

Node lets us run js on a server

Node is single-threaded and event-driven which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

>For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.

### What the heck is the event loop anyway? by Philip Roberts

Single thread means it can execute one thing at a time.

Call stack a data struct that records where in the program we are.

Blocking (code that is slow) ie: network requests. While requests are running you cant do anything.

Asynchronous callbacks (here's some code run that and run a callback function)

Concurrency & the Event loop the browser is more than just the run time. APIs are like threads you can just make calls to. This creates concurrency.

When web api calls are done it gets pushed to a task queue.

Eventloop's job is to look at the stack and task queue. If the stack is empty it pushes the task queue event to the stack.

Video time stamped when Philip talks about this eventloop https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ?t=770

setTimeout at 0? when set to 0 it will push the call back function to the task queue immediately. setTimeout is used to defer code till the stack is cleared.

Callbacks, any function that another function calls, or an async function.

The render que is executed every 16 miliseconds. If render is blocked you cant click the screen.

"Dont put crappy slow code on the stack" that is how programs run slowly.

### What kind of Apps is Node.js suited to

Node is suited for building apps that require some form of real-time interaction ie: chat sites, some place you can watch a document be edited live. It's also good for building APIs that handle lots of requests that are I/O driven.

### Advantages to Node

You can easily share code between the server and the client.

It speaks JSON - the most important data exchange format on the web when interacting with object databases.
