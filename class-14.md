# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

I will do a quick summary of the article

Written by Julia Rozovsky.

The article starts with talking about how M.B.A programs help students with team building to ready them for the workplace.

She didnt have a good experience with her study group. So she looked for a different group.

She then found a group that she clicked with.

More and more work is becoming team based in these days. ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’

Studies show that when software devs work together they tend to inovate faster, see mistakes quicker and find better solutions to problems.

This brings us to the main topic, google.

In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle

They studied hundreds of google's teams to see what made teams work.

They couldnt find any patterns even with all that data.

Group Norms, unspoken rules that make a group work. This varries per group but every group has them. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather

Our story's protagonist, Rozovsky, needed to figure out which group norms were the best for productivity.

The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

Here's something interesting from the article too:
"Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,’’ said Anita Woolley, the study’s lead author. ‘‘Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone’s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role."

As long as each team member got to speak the team did well. It's a turn-taking thing.

If only one person spoke the collective intelligence declined.

A foundation of a good team is one where the members dont get embarrassed, rejected or punish for bringing up an idea.
