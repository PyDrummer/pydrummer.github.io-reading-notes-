# The Call Stack and Debugging

## Call Stack Defined

> A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

This MDN basically explains the process of how JS reads the code.

This is pretty much review of what we have been doing so far.

### The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call)

It tells it when each function's turn is!

Functions are ran each once at a time from top to bottom.

It means the call stack is synchronous.

> In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

A call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

#### LIFO: 
When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

#### Temporarily store: 
When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

#### Manage function invocation (call): 
The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

#### What causes a stack overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## JavaScript error messages && debugging

### Types of error messages
The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message that the one we saw just moments ago, it usually appears on your console (being developer tools of the browser, terminal or whatever else you are using).

#### Reference errors
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

#### Syntax errors
I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

#### Range errors
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

#### Type errors
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

### Debugging
To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).

### Handling errors
About the light blue part of our earliest example of an error message, that shows up like that when we do not handle errors properly, meaning that anything after that error will not be executed. To avoid this we usually try to catch the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error (this fallback can be a 404 page which is normally not that graceful but is better than a page to just stop working).
