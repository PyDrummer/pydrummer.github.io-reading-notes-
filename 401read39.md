# React 3

## Assets

Static assets like images can be under the 'public' directory.

Next.js can handle Images with the 'next/image'.

Exaple:
```
import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)
```

With this you can set the height, width and alt all within a component.

## Metadata

```
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}
```

This is an easy way to put all the 'Head' information in a function called FirstPost.

## CSS

You can write css within a React component.

Example:
```
<style jsx>{`
  â€¦
`}</style>
```
