# Graphs

## What is it?

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Types of graphs

### Undirected

Each has either undirected or bi-directional edges. Basically means there is no direction to it.

### Directed

Aka, digraph, every edge is directed. Ie: Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

### Completed Graph

A completed graph has all nodes connected.

### Connected Graph

A graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### Disconnected Graph

A graph where some vertices may not have edges.

### Acyclic

A form of directed graph, without cycles.

> A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

### Cyclic

> A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

### Adjaceny Matrix

This is basically a 2d array.

### Adjaceny List

Basically a collection of linked lists.

## Weighted Graph

The best way to think about this with either weight matrix or list is:

a to b is 4, a to d is 9, a to c is 3.

a -> b,4, -> d,9 -> c,3

## Traversing methods

- Breadth first, you start at a specific vertex/node which must be declared. Its similar to a tree traversal except graphs can result in infinite loops. To prevent that we must identify which vertex has been seen already. Add each vertex into a 'visited' set till traversal is completed.

Begin with enqueing (the start) loop while the node has nodes, dequeue that first node and if the dequeued node has unvisitied children then add then to the queue.

```
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
```

- Depth, uses a stack not a queue. Push the root onto the stack, loop 'while the stack is not empty'. Peek at the top node, if the top node has unvisited children, add the top to 'visited' and push the unvisited children to the back of the stack. If the top node doesnt have anymore children then pop it.

## How is this used in the real world?


- GPS and Mapping
- Driving Directions
- Social Network
- Airline Traffic
- Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
