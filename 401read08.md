# List Comprehension

List compression is an easy way to create lists.

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. 

The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

Here is an example:
```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```

is the same as this:

```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```

Here is a run down of the basic syntax:

[ expression for item in list if conditional ]

is the same as:

for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression

The article gives some use cases:

```
[x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
['a', 'b', 'c']


string = "Hello 12345 World"
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
print numbers

>> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```

You can also use this with functions:

 ```
 def double(x):
  return x*2
>>> print double(10)
20

comprehension:

[double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

With added conditions:

[double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

 ```

Comprehensions can clean up code and reduce the amount of lines that are needed to type out.
