# jQuery, Events and DOM

### jQuery

Here is a quick guide on the things to know about jQuery

```
// jQuery gets started with a $

$('HTML element here') // This is the jQuery object. This is the same as a CSS style selector.

// Now that we have an object lets do something with it.
// Select a p element in html with a class of cool. Add a new class of 'sweet' to it.

$('p.cool').addClass('sweet');

// Notice how we use a dot after the jQuery object to then call a method. 
// Inside the method addClass we have 'sweet'. So now p.cool will become p.sweet.
```

jQuery must be called inside the HTML for your code to know what you're doing.

Use: <script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.js"></script\> inside your HTML within the body.

Now that we know how to make a jQuery object and how to add a method to it lets do something more with that.

```
$('p.cool').on('click', function() {
    $(this).addClass('sweet');
});
```
What we have done is said when our p element with a class of 'cool' is clicked it will run a function of adding a class to 'this' or rather p.cool.

Other things you can do include adding a fade in/fade out effect.

### Finding Elements while using jQuery

With jQuery it's very similar to CSS in finding the elements you want to effect.

### Doing things with the selector

Page 304 in JavaScript and jQuery book by Jon Duckett will show great examples how to do things with the selector such as that addClass method we used earlier.

### Dot notation

If you want to use multiple methods on one element you can accomplish this with dot notation example:

```
$('p.cool').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(2000);
```

this hides the element p with a class of cool, then delay creates a pause and fadeIn fades the element.

### Ready

With plain JavaScript if the browser hasn't loaded up the DOM tree then jQuery wont be able to select elements from it.

The .ready() will still work even if your JS file is placed at the end of the HTML file.

$(document).ready(function() {
//code here
});

This type of function will only run when the page is ready.

Short hand for this is:

$(function() {
//code here
});

### .html() & .text()

These methods are used to retrieve information from either the HTML or the text.

.html() will return the selected elements and text within, while the text will return only the text within those elements.

#### Updating with .html(), .text(), .reaplaceWith(), .remove()

.html() and .text() can be used as 'setters' to update content. They will replace the content of each element they match with.

.replaceWith() and .remove() will replace and remove the elements they match with. Note that it will do this to all child elements as well.

#### .before(), .after() .prepend(), .append()

These methods are used in the following ways:

- .before(), inserts content before the selected element.
- .after(), inserts content after the selected element.
- .prepend(), inserts content inside the selected element after the opening tag.
- .append(), inserts content inside the selected element before the closing tag.

#### .attr(), .removeAttr(), .addClass(), .removeClass()

- .attr(), used to get or set a specific attribute and it's value. For instance, an id
- .removeAttr(), used to remove a specific attribute
- .addClass(), adds a new value to the exisitng value of the class attribute.
- .removeClass(), used to remove the value in an exisiting value in class.

#### Changing CSS Rules

By using .css() you can edit css properties inside the ().

for example if you wanted to change the background color of a div element:

$('div').css('background-color', 'green');

#### .each(), this or $(this)

.each allows you to preform a statement on one or more of each item in that selection of elements. It's like a loop.

$('div').each(function() {
//code here
});

now whatever code you write inside that function will apply to each div in the HTML.

this or $(this)
