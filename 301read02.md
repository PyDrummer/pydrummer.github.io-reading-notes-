# jQuery, Events and DOM

### jQuery

Here is a quick guide on the things to know about jQuery

```
// jQuery gets started with a $

$('HTML element here') // This is the jQuery object. This is the same as a CSS style selector.

// Now that we have an object lets do something with it.
// Select a p element in html with a class of cool. Add a new class of 'sweet' to it.

$('p.cool').addClass('sweet');

// Notice how we use a dot after the jQuery object to then call a method. 
// Inside the method addClass we have 'sweet'. So now p.cool will become p.sweet.
```

jQuery must be called inside the HTML for your code to know what you're doing.

Use: <script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.js"></script\> inside your HTML within the body.

Now that we know how to make a jQuery object and how to add a method to it lets do something more with that.

```
$('p.cool').on('click', function() {
    $(this).addClass('sweet');
});
```
What we have done is said when our p element with a class of 'cool' is clicked it will run a function of adding a class to 'this' or rather p.cool.

Other things you can do include adding a fade in/fade out effect.

### Finding Elements while using jQuery

With jQuery it's very similar to CSS in finding the elements you want to effect.

### Doing things with the selector

Page 304 in JavaScript and jQuery book by Jon Duckett will show great examples how to do things with the selector such as that addClass method we used earlier.
