# Docker!

## What is it?

Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

Virtual machines are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

## What's a container?

Docker containers are like apartments: they share common infrastructure like plumbing and heating, but come in various sizes that match the exact needs of an owner.

## What are images?

Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker. 

- An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. 

- A container is a running instance of the image.

## How do i set up a docker project?

Start with making your directory, CD into that directory

Next you'll want to define the image with:

```touch Dockerfile``` 
```FROM python:3.7-alpine```

in the console.

In this case weâ€™ll be using the official Docker image for Python 3.7, specifically the alpine version which includes only the bare minimum needed to run Python.

Now we can build

```docker image build .```

It should do some stuff then read out ```Successfully built b2c276538711```

### Container time

Now it's time to make a new directory inside the project and start our Django stuff.

*Do all the django install*

Create a Dockerfile in the django project.

```touch Dockerfile```
```touch docker-compose.yml```

This Dockerfile has several commands. RUN, COPY, and ADD each create a new layer.

Your dockerfile should look like this:
```
# Dockerfile

# Python version
FROM python:3.7-alpine

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Set work directory
WORKDIR /code

# Install dependencies
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock /code/
RUN pip install pipenv && pipenv install --system

# Copy project
COPY . /code/
```

Main takeaways;
### ORDER MATTERS

Now Django should be running from a container.
