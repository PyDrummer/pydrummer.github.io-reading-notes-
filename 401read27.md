# JSON Web Tokens

## What are they?

JWT (JSON web token) is a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit info between parties.

It includes a digitial signature with it's transmission.

JWTs can be encrypted to provide extra security and secrecy.

## When is a JWT used?

JWTs are great for single sign on features in websites. 

Secure trasmission of data between parties.

## How do I structure a JWT?

They consist always of three parts:

- **Header**:
  - The type of token
  - The signing algo used (HMAC, SHA256, RSA)
- Payload:
  - Registered claims
  - Public claims
  - Private claims
- Signature:
  - Used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

Seperated by a dot they are in this format ```xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz```

## How does it work?

After the user signs in a JWT is returned. When the user wants to access a protected route or resource the JWT is sent. The server checks for authorization. If all is good the user can access the info they want.

## Why are JWTs important?

JSON files are encoded smaller so they take up less data. JSON parsers are common in most programming languages. JSON can be used on multiple platforms including mobile.


# How to Use JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework

A JWT is an authorization token that should be included in all requests.

The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and a refresh token.

Access tokens typically are short-lived(5 mins), refresh tokens can live a bit longer(24 hours).

Because of the token's lifespan you can get good security.

## How do I install this?

*In the console:*
```poetry install djangorestframework_simplejwt```

*In the project's settings.py:*
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
}
```

*Project's urls.py*
```
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
    # Your URLs...
    path('api/token/', jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]
```

*In the app's views.py"*
```
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated


class HelloView(APIView):
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)

    def get(self, request):
        content = {'message': 'Hello, World!'}
        return Response(content)
```

*In the app's urls.py*
```
from django.urls import path
from myapi.core import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.HelloView.as_view(), name='hello'),
]
```

First step is to authenticate and obtain the token. The endpoint is /api/token/ and it only accepts POST requests.

You store the response body in the localStorage.

Now you should be able to access the information.
