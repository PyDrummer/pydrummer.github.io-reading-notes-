# EJS

## How to set it up

Begin with an npm init

Next npm install express body-parser cors and ejs

Bring in all the dependencies. Including something called path.

```
use views to set the path
app.set('views', path.join(_dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

Create an index.ejs file under a folder called views.

Then set the route

```
app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.render('index');
});
```

## Using the index

If you add a variable inside the response you can call it inside the index.ejs file
```
app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.render('index', {
  foo = 'bar'
  });
});
```

Inside the ejs file:

```
<h1> Hello <%= foo %></h1>
```

Now we will see 'bar' inside the h1.

## How to iterate over an array object

Example:
```
app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.render('index', {
  person = [{
  name: 'Anthony',
  name: 'Dave'}]
  });
});
```

inside ejs:

```
<ul>
  <% for(var person of people) { %>
  <li><%= person.name %></li>
  <% }%>
</ul>
```
This for loop will grab each object inside the person array and place it inside a li element.

## If/Else Statements

example:
```
<ul>
  <% for(var person of people) { %>
    <% if (person.name === 'dave') { %>
    <li>This is definitely dave!<%= person.name %></li>
    <% } else { %>
    <li>This is definitely not dave! This is <%= person.name %></li>
  <% }%>
</ul>
```
This shows that if the person array's name at that iteration equals dave say something different. The else statment runs if it's not dave.

## Layouts

Being by creating a couple of files, you might use "layout.ejs" and "about.ejs"

*** npm install --save express-ejs-layouts
must be ran in the terminal for this to work.

*back in the server.js file:
```
var expressLayouts = require('express-ejs-layouts');
// and
app.use(expressLayouts);
```
Now the layout.ejs file is being used.

The layout file can be used like a wrapper for HTML code.

Typically you can put the <html\>,<head\>,<title>, and <body\> elements inside the layout.ejs

You would put other tags and information inside the about.ejs.

Now we must route our about.ejs file.
```
app.get('/about', function(request, response) {
  response.render('about');
});
```
Now the HTML inside the about file will show up at the route '/about' in the webpage.

## Partials (nav bar, footer, reuseable stuff)

to bring in a partial file which your webpage would need you can use
```
<%= include('partials/filename') %>
```
Just make sure you route correctly to the file name.
