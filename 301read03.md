# Flexbox and Templating

### Templating with Mustache

Templating is a quick way to render client-side view templates with JS using a JSON source.

The article talks about using mustache.js which is 'logic-less". This basically means it doesnt have a bunch of if/else/loops instead there are only tags.

> mustache template system ... is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. 

Mustache uses {{ two braces }} for placeholders that will be replaced by whichever property the object passes in.

The article uses this example to replace a name in an HTML element.

### A Complete Guide to Flexbox

This is example of how to make a flex container:

display: flex;

Keep in mind it will make a flex context for all it's direct children

### Flex Direction 

Says which direction the flex items are placed in the flex container

> Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

Here is the example:

flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

> row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl

> row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl

> column: same as row but top to bottom

> column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

Flex items will try to fit everything onto one line.

### Flex-wrap

Is used to make the items wrap as needed

flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;

> nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line

> wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.

> wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.

### Justify-content

This will determine how much space is between the items.

justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;

> flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.

> flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.

> start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.

> end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.

> left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.

> right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.

> center: items are centered along the line

> space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line

> space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.

> space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

### Align Items

This will define how the flex itmes sit on the cross axis, basically the justify content version but for up and down (horizontal)

align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;

> stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)

> flex-start / start / self-start: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.

> flex-end / end / self-end: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
center: items are centered in the cross-axis

> baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align

Safe and unsafe deals with helping prevent aligning elements if the content becomes inaccessable

### Align-content

This will determine where the flex containers lines with the extra space will go.

align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;

> normal (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.

> flex-start / start: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.

> flex-end / end: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.

> center: items centered in the container

> space-between: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end

> space-around: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line

> space-evenly: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them

> stretch: lines stretch to take up the remaining space

### Order

order: 5; /* default is 0 */

> By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

### Flex-grow

Pretty self explainitory, defines the ability for the flex items to grow when needed. 

> If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

### Flex shrink

Same as flex-grow just in the opposite direction

### Flex-basis

> This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. 

### Flex

Just a shorthand version of flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. Defaults are 0, 1 and Auto

flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]

> It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.

### Align-self

> This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.

align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
