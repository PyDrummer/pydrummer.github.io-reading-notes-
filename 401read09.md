# Dunder Methods

What are they?

They start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__. They are special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes.

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box.

To fix this, you can add a __len__ dunder method to your class:

```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42
```

> If you want to write more Pythonic code, knowing how and when to use dunder methods is an important step.

## \_\_init__

```
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```

The init takes care of setting up the object. In this case it receives the owner name, an optional start amount and defines an internal transactions list to keep track of deposits and withdrawals.

Now we can create a new instanciation of the class:

```
>>> acc = Account('bob')  # default amount = 0
>>> acc = Account('bob', 10)
```

### Important ones to know:

\_\_repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of \_\_repr__ is to be unambiguous.

\_\_str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
            
will produce:
str(acc)
'Account of bob with starting amount: 10'

>>> print(acc)
"Account of bob with starting amount: 10"

>>> repr(acc)
"Account('bob', 10)"

```

# Iteration

The article goes on to create a add_transaction class method and a property:

```
def add_transaction(self, amount):
    if not isinstance(amount, int):
        raise ValueError('please use int for amount')
    self._transactions.append(amount)
    
@property
def balance(self):
    return self.amount + sum(self._transactions)

>>> acc = Account('bob', 10)

>>> acc.add_transaction(20)
>>> acc.add_transaction(-10)
>>> acc.add_transaction(50)
>>> acc.add_transaction(-20)
>>> acc.add_transaction(30)

>>> acc.balance
80

```

They assigned acc to the new instanciation and used that method to add some transactions. Finally at the end they referenced that balance property to show the transactions all added up.

By adding some dunder methods you can now iterate over these:

```
These are inside the Account class:
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._transactions)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._transactions[position]
    
To iterate in a reversed order:
    def __reversed__(self):
    return self[::-1]
        

In the console/app:
>>> len(acc)
5

>>> for t in acc:
...    print(t)
20
-10
50
-20
30

>>> acc[1]
-10

>>> list(reversed(acc))
[30, -20, 50, -10, 20]

```

### \_\_call__

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __call__(self):
        print('Start amount: {}'.format(self.amount))
        print('Transactions: ')
        for transaction in self:
            print(transaction)
        print('\nBalance: {}'.format(self.balance))
```

Now by using the previous code above and from the other examples we could call the object and it will run that \_\_call__ class method

```
>>> acc()
Start amount: 10
Transactions:
20
-10
50
-20
30
Balance: 80
```

# Probability

What is probability?

“What is the chance of an event happening?” 

Here is the article's example of running a heads or tails simulation:

```
import random
def coin_trial():
heads = 0
for i in range(100):
    if random.random() <= 0.5:
        heads +=1
    return heads
def simulate(n):
    trials = []
    for i in range(n):
        trials.append(coin_trial())
    return(sum(trials)/n)
simulate(10)
>>> 5.4
simulate(100)
>>> 4.83
simulate(1000)
>>> 5.055
simulate(1000000)
>>> 4.999781
```

The data above shows that as you flip more coins the results become closer to what we'd expect from a usual head or tails probability (50/50).

As a data scientist, having an intuitive understanding on common statistical measures represent will give you an edge on developing your own theories and the ability to subsequently test these theories.
